# scripts/

## Overview
- Repo scripts (currently minimal); root `npm run smoke` points here.

## Where To Look
| Task | Location |
|------|----------|
| Smoke test entry (currently missing) | `scripts/smoke/run-all.sh` |

## Gotchas
- `scripts/smoke/` exists but is empty; `npm run smoke` will fail until `scripts/smoke/run-all.sh` is added.
